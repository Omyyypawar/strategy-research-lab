# strategy-research-lab
AI-powered quant research + backtesting system.

Strategy Research Lab is my personal project to build the core tools that quant trading teams use — but from scratch and in public.
It’s a mix of data engineering, machine learning, research automation, and live trading.

🔧 What it includes
1]Data pipeline: pulling + cleaning market data

2]Feature engineering: rolling stats, volatility, momentum, factors

3]ML signals: models that generate long/flat/short predictions

4]Backtesting engine: equity curves, drawdowns, Sharpe, PnL

5]Execution layer: Binance API for paper trading

6]Dashboard: Streamlit interface for monitoring everything

📌 Current Status
Actively building.

#What’s done so far:
1)Market data pipeline
2)Feature engineering
3)ML signal generation
4)Signal → trade logic
5)Backtesting
6)Binance paper-trading setup
7)Dashboard skeleton

#Next steps:
1)Walk-forward validation
2)Better model explainability
3)Multi-asset support

🎯 Why I'm Building This
Not a trading bot, not a college assignment but building a real research engine — the type used inside quant firms — to understand how alpha is created, tested, and deployed.

#Long-term vision:
A small, independent quant research studio or a B2B tool for systematic traders.
